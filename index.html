      <p class="media-text">Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.<br>
      Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!</p>
